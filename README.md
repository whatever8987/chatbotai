Okay, let's break the project down into logical phases. This approach allows you to build and test components incrementally, making the project more manageable.

Here is a phased project plan:

Project Phased Plan: LLM Voice Assistant

This plan breaks down the development of the LLM Voice Assistant into sequential phases, each with specific goals, tasks, and deliverables.

Phase 1: Foundation - Core Django & User Management

Goal: Establish the basic Django project structure, set up essential infrastructure (database, environment variables), and implement user authentication and contact management APIs.

Key Tasks:

Set up the Django project (voice_assistant_project/).

Configure settings.py (database, static/media, installed apps).

Set up python-dotenv for environment variable management (.env).

Configure ASGI (asgi.py) for future WebSocket integration.

Create the users Django app.

Implement User Registration, Login, and basic Profile APIs using Django REST Framework and possibly Simple JWT for tokens.

Create the contacts Django app.

Define the Contact model (linked to User).

Implement DRF APIs for Contact CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), ensuring user ownership.

Set up database migrations and apply them.

Configure Django Admin for basic model management.

Initial setup of requirements.txt or requirements/ directory.

Expected Outcomes:

A running Django development server.

Database is set up and migrated.

Users can register and log in via API.

Authenticated users can add, view, update, and delete their contacts via API.

Basic project structure is in place.

Relevant Apps/Components: voice_assistant_project/, users/, contacts/.

Dependencies: Python, Database (PostgreSQL).

Phase 2: Telephony Integration & Basic Call Bridging

Goal: Integrate with a CPaaS provider (like Twilio) to handle incoming calls and initiate outgoing calls. Establish the connection bridge for real-time audio, even if the audio isn't processed by the AI yet.

Key Tasks:

Choose a CPaaS provider and set up an account/phone number.

Install the CPaaS Python SDK.

Create the telephony Django app.

Define the CallLog model.

Implement the CPaaS webhook view (/telephony/incoming/) that receives incoming call notifications. This view should generate TwiML (or equivalent) to tell the CPaaS to connect the audio to a WebSocket URL (which will be handled by our FastAPI service later).

Implement a view/internal function to initiate outgoing calls using the CPaaS SDK (cpaas_client.py).

Set up Celery and a message broker (Redis). Configure celery_app.py.

Create a Celery task in telephony.tasks to handle asynchronous outgoing call initiation.

Create the realtime_audio directory/app structure.

Set up a minimal FastAPI app (realtime_audio/main.py) that includes a FastRTC Stream instance.

Define a basic realtime_audio.rtc_handler.py that receives audio but maybe just logs it or sends back dummy audio (e.g., silence or a simple tone). The focus is on establishing the WebSocket connection.

Integrate the FastAPI app into your deployment strategy (either mounted in Django's asgi.py or run as a separate Uvicorn process).

Configure CPaaS webhooks to point to your deployed Django telephony endpoint and the FastAPI WebSocket endpoint.

Expected Outcomes:

Incoming calls to your CPaaS number trigger your Django webhook.

Your Django webhook responds with instructions for the CPaaS.

The CPaaS connects the call audio to your FastAPI/FastRTC WebSocket.

Your FastAPI service successfully receives the WebSocket connection.

You can trigger an outgoing call from your Django backend (e.g., via a management command or a temporary API endpoint), and the call connects via the CPaaS.

Audio frames are being sent/received over the WebSocket in realtime_audio, even if they aren't meaningful yet.

Relevant Apps/Components: telephony/, realtime_audio/, Celery, CPaaS SDK.

Dependencies: Phase 1 completed, CPaaS account, Redis/Message Broker, FastAPI, FastRTC, Uvicorn.

Phase 3: Core AI Conversation (STT, TTS, LLM)

Goal: Connect the real-time audio stream to AI processing. Add Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS). Implement a basic interaction with an LLM based on text transcripts, sending the spoken response back.

Key Tasks:

Choose STT and TTS providers/libraries and install SDKs.

Choose an LLM provider and install the SDK.

Create the ai_core Django app.

Define the ConversationState model.

Implement ai_core.llm_interface.py for basic LLM interaction (sending a prompt, getting text response).

Modify realtime_audio.rtc_handler.py:

Add STT integration: Convert incoming audio frames to text transcripts.

Send text transcripts to ai_core for processing (likely via a Celery task: ai_core.tasks.process_audio_transcript_task).

Receive text responses back from ai_core (needs a mechanism - e.g., a queue).

Add TTS integration: Convert incoming text responses to outgoing audio frames.

Implement ai_core.tasks.process_audio_transcript_task:

Receive transcript from realtime_audio.

Retrieve/update ConversationState (basic history).

Send transcript and history to the LLM via ai_core.llm_interface.

Get text response from LLM.

Send text response back to realtime_audio (mechanism TBD).

Expected Outcomes:

You can call in or receive a call.

Your speech is transcribed to text (viewable in logs/debugger).

The text is sent to the AI Core.

The AI Core sends the text to the LLM and gets a basic response.

The text response is sent back to realtime_audio.

realtime_audio converts the text response to speech.

You can hear the AI's spoken response on the phone call.

Basic conversation flow (audio -> text -> LLM -> text -> audio) is working.

Relevant Apps/Components: realtime_audio/, ai_core/, STT/TTS Libraries/APIs, LLM Provider SDK/API.

Dependencies: Phase 2 completed, STT/TTS/LLM API access, Celery working.

Phase 4: Knowledge Base (RAG) Integration

Goal: Enable the AI assistant to answer questions based on user-provided documents and websites using RAG.

Key Tasks:

Choose a Vector Database and set it up (or configure pgvector). Install necessary libraries/clients.

Choose an Embedding Model and set it up.

Create the knowledge_base Django app.

Define DataSource and DocumentChunk models.

Implement API endpoints (/api/knowledge-base/) for uploading files and providing URLs.

Create knowledge_base.processing.py with functions for parsing, chunking, and embedding.

Create knowledge_base.search.py with the vector search/retrieval function.

Create Celery tasks in knowledge_base.tasks for asynchronous processing of uploaded sources.

Modify assistants.models.py to link AssistantConfig to knowledge_base.DataSource.

Create ai_core.rag_orchestrator.py to handle the RAG pipeline within ai_core.

Modify ai_core.tasks.process_audio_transcript_task:

Before sending to the LLM, call rag_orchestrator.augment_prompt.

augment_prompt will call knowledge_base.search.search_knowledge_base based on the user's query and linked data sources.

Use the retrieved snippets to construct an augmented prompt for the LLM.

Update ai_core.llm_interface if needed to handle larger/structured prompts for RAG.

Expected Outcomes:

Users can upload documents/links via API.

Uploaded sources are processed in the background (parsed, chunked, embedded).

The vector database contains embeddings of your document chunks.

During a call, if the user asks a question relevant to an uploaded document linked to their assistant, the AI retrieves the relevant sections and uses them to inform its response.

Relevant Apps/Components: knowledge_base/, ai_core/, Vector Database, Embedding Model.

Dependencies: Phase 3 completed, Vector DB set up, Embedding Model access.

Phase 5: Tooling Implementation

Goal: Enable the AI assistant to perform specific actions by calling external tools (like web search).

Key Tasks:

Refine the ai_core.tool_manager.py logic. This involves:

Providing the LLM with descriptions of the available tools (often via a specific prompt format or API feature like function calling).

Parsing the LLM's response to detect if it wants to call a tool.

Calling the appropriate function in the tools app if a tool is requested.

Handling the output of the tool (potentially sending it back to the LLM for a final response).

Create the tools Django app.

Implement at least one tool (e.g., tools.web_search.py) that interacts with an external API (like a search API).

Update assistants.models.py to allow enabling/disabling specific tools for an AssistantConfig.

Integrate the tool_manager into the ai_core.tasks.process_audio_transcript_task flow after RAG, but before the final LLM call (or integrated within the LLM call depending on the model's capabilities).

Expected Outcomes:

The AI understands when it needs to use a tool based on the user's request.

The AI can successfully call the implemented tool(s).

The AI can use the output of the tool(s) to formulate its response to the user during a call.

Relevant Apps/Components: ai_core/, tools/, External Tool APIs (e.g., Search API).

Dependencies: Phase 3 completed (Phase 4 concurrently or before/after based on preference, but Tooling and RAG are enhancements to core AI). LLM Provider must support tool calling or you need a parsing layer.

Phase 6: Assistant Configuration, Refinement & Hardening

Goal: Finalize the user-facing configuration for assistants and refine the overall system for stability, error handling, and usability.

Key Tasks:

Implement the full DRF API for assistants.views to manage AssistantConfig (linking users, LLM settings, enabled tools, linked DataSource objects).

Improve error handling throughout the system (CPaaS errors, LLM errors, tool errors, STT/TTS errors, Vector DB errors). Implement retries where appropriate (Celery).

Refine the communication mechanism between realtime_audio and ai_core tasks (e.g., using Redis Pub/Sub or dedicated queues for sending results back).

Implement more detailed logging and monitoring.

Review and optimize database queries.

Implement graceful shutdown for the realtime_audio service.

Add more sophisticated conversation state management if needed (e.g., handling interruptions, keeping track of tool state across turns).

Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration).

Expected Outcomes:

Users have full control over configuring their AI assistants via the API.

The system is more robust to external service failures.

Improved logging helps diagnose issues.

Codebase is more stable and maintainable.

Relevant Apps/Components: All apps, Celery, Logging, Monitoring.

Dependencies: Phases 1-5 functionally complete.

Phase 7: Deployment & Operations

Goal: Deploy the application to a production environment and establish operational procedures.

Key Tasks:

Choose a hosting provider (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc.).

Set up production database, message broker, and vector database instances.

Configure environment variables for production.

Set up an ASGI server (Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers) for the Django app.

Set up a Uvicorn server for the FastAPI realtime_audio app (likely as a separate service).

Configure a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) to handle HTTPS and route traffic to the Django and FastAPI services.

Configure CPaaS webhooks to point to your production domain.

Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

Set up monitoring and alerting (application logs, server metrics, task queue status).

Plan for scaling individual components (web servers, task workers, vector DB, CPaaS usage).

Implement backup and restore procedures.

Expected Outcomes:

The application is accessible and functional in a production environment.

Automated deployment process is in place.

System performance and errors are being monitored.

Operational procedures are documented.

Relevant Apps/Components: Deployment Infrastructure, All Apps, CI/CD tools, Monitoring tools.

Dependencies: Phase 6 completed.

This phased approach breaks the complex project into manageable parts, allowing you to focus on specific functionalities in each stage. Remember to prioritize thorough testing and debugging at the end of each phase before moving on.
