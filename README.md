Use code with caution.
Note: The app.py file from the previous structure is now redundant as the API server (api/server.py) will handle the main logic flow.
Revised Detailed Phases:
Phase 1: Basic FastAPI API Server Setup
Goal: Get a functional FastAPI server running that can receive basic HTTP requests.
Tasks:
Install the fastapi and uvicorn Python libraries.
Create the api directory and the api/server.py file.
Write basic FastAPI code in api/server.py to create a simple endpoint (e.g., GET /) that returns a message.
Configure a Replit workflow to run this FastAPI application using uvicorn. Configure it to run on 0.0.0.0:5000 and wait for port 5000.
Tools Used: packager_tool, str_replace_editor, workflows_set_run_config_tool, web_application_feedback_tool.
Current Status: We have created the initial files and some directories (requirements.txt, tasks/, tasks/calling/). We need to create the api/ directory and the api/server.py file.
Next Action: Install fastapi and uvicorn, create api/ and api/server.py, write basic FastAPI code, and set up the workflow.
Phase 2: Command Handling API Endpoint
Goal: Create an API endpoint specifically for sending chatbot commands and receiving responses.
Tasks:
Modify api/server.py to include a POST /command endpoint that accepts a message (e.g., in the request body as JSON).
Add logic in api/server.py to process this message. Start with a simple test (e.g., if the message is "hello", return a JSON response like {"reply": "Hi there!"}).
Explore the automatic API documentation provided by FastAPI (usually accessible at /docs on the running server).
Tools Used: str_replace_editor, web_application_feedback_tool (we can use the webview to access /docs and potentially bash with curl to test the POST /command endpoint).
Next Action (after Phase 1 is verified): Implement the /command endpoint logic.
Phase 3: Voice Agent with FastRTC, Twilio, and Ollama
Goal: Integrate the fastrtc/Twilio/Ollama voice agent functionality. This phase is similar to the previous plan, but triggered and managed by the API server.
Tasks:
Request necessary secret keys (Twilio, Ollama).
Install required Python libraries (fastrtc, twilio, ollama, etc.).
Attempt to install ollama as a system dependency and set up its workflow.
Create tasks/calling/voice_agent_server.py (or integrate this logic into api/server.py if feasible) with the fastrtc application code. Ensure it runs on port 5000 if kept separate, or is integrated into the main FastAPI app on port 5000.
Create tasks/calling/twilio_utils.py to initiate outgoing calls.
Add an endpoint to the main API server (e.g., POST /tasks/calling/initiate) or modify the /command endpoint logic in api/server.py to recognize a "call [number]" command and use twilio_utils.py.
Ensure the Twilio webhook is configured to point to your Replit app's public URL + the correct endpoint (/incoming-call or similar if integrated).
Tools Used: ask_secrets, packager_tool, workflows_set_run_config_tool, str_replace_editor, bash (potentially for ollama), web_application_feedback_tool (for testing the API and observing results).
Next Action (after Phase 2 is verified): Implement the voice agent components.
Phase 4: Google Reviews API Integration
Goal: Add API endpoints or command handling for Google Reviews.
Tasks:
Request Google API secrets.
Install Google API client libraries.
Create tasks/google_reviews.py.
Add endpoints to api/server.py (e.g., GET /tasks/google_reviews, POST /tasks/google_reviews/reply) or extend the /command endpoint logic to handle Google Review commands.
Tools Used: ask_secrets, packager_tool, str_replace_editor, web_application_feedback_tool.
Next Action (after Phase 3 is functional): Implement the Google Reviews integration.
Phase 5: Facebook Posting API Integration
Goal: Add API endpoints or command handling for Facebook posting.
Tasks:
Explain methods and complexities.
Request Facebook secrets/credentials.
Install relevant libraries and system dependencies.
Create tasks/facebook.py.
Add endpoints to api/server.py (e.g., POST /tasks/facebook/post) or extend the /command endpoint logic.
Tools Used: ask_secrets, packager_tool, str_replace_editor, bash, web_application_feedback_tool.
Next Action (after Phase 4 is functional): Implement the Facebook posting feature.
Phase 6: Optional: Integrate AI Model for NLU
Goal: Improve command understanding using an AI model.
Tasks:
Explain the benefit.
Request OpenAI API key.
Install the openai library.
Modify the command processing logic in api/server.py to use the AI model to interpret user input before calling specific task functions.
Tools Used: ask_secrets, packager_tool, str_replace_editor, web_application_feedback_tool.
Next Action (can be done any time after Phase 2): Integrate the AI model.
Phase 7: Final Review and Deployment Suggestion
Goal: Ensure the application is working well and suggest deployment.
Tasks:
Review all components and logs.
Fix any remaining bugs.
Test all API endpoints.
Suggest deployment to the user.
Tools Used: web_application_feedback_tool, suggest_deploy.
Next Action (after all desired features are working): Final checks and suggest deployment.
